# xlxd ambe server checker
This script in Python 3 restarts the xlxd service if the public ip address of the ambed server changes, typical of those who have ADSL and Dynamic DNS. It is useful in case the ambe server is not installed on the same server as xlxd. The service creates log files to monitor the change of public IP.
